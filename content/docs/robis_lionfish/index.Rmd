# Q14: What is the status of non-indigenous species and how is it changing?

## Notable Invasive Species
### Lionfish
```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('imgcap',
    title="Although beautiful, the invasive lionfish (*Pterois volitans*) may pose a major threat to FKNMS native wildlife.",

)
```

The lionfish is spread throughout the FK as shown by the following map of
*Pterois volitans* occurrence records in OBIS:

```{r map lionfish}
data <- robis::occurrence(
    "Pterois volitans",
    geometry = "POLYGON ((-83.15 25.65, -80.066667 25.65, -80.066667 24.3, -83.15 24.3, -83.15 25.65))"
)
# for robis v1:
#robis::leafletmap(data)
# for robis v2:
robis::map_leaflet(data)
```

The rate of occurrences in the FK is a very recent development.
The following timeseries of occurrences in OBIS shows just how quickly the lionfish has spread.

```{r lionfish timeseries}
ggplot2::ggplot(data) + ggplot2::geom_bar(ggplot2::aes(date_year), width = 1)
```

As of 2018-12, the OBIS data on this area is sparse, with all (or almost all?)
data coming from the Reef Visual Census (RVC) program.
