Habitat and living resources in the Keys are undergoing unprecedented changes.
These changes are apparent in abundances of coral, invertebrates, seagrass, mangrove, disease, bleaching, and algae.

## Fish and Lobster inside/outside of MPAs (Aug)
TODO: BB and TM rework existing MBON/RVC data
TODO: LM will send formatted Tom Matthews Lobster data to BB and TM

## Benthic Community Composition has changed (After Aug)
TODO: TBD. Should be straightforward to rework existing MBON data

Benthic habitats in 2007 from [USGS's "*Benthic Ecosystems*"](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/2007/1751/professional-paper/figures/benthic-ecosystems.html):

# Indicators:
## Fish abundance, diversity, size and species
TODO: Data: RVC data already available to FKNMS infographics

TODO: Snapper/grouper vs parrotfish (targeted/non-targeted)

TODO: Lobster size structure study [Not RVC data; not continuing to be collected so not for automation]

RVC fish in/out MPAs: MPAs work. ***Key Story for Aug***
Eg info-fk/corals -> Exploited Reef Fish (focal)

TODO: So consolidate time-series into snapper-grouper complex?
TODO: Alternative infographic data representation?

TODO: Lobster study: MPAs can cover a range of life history reqs/habitat
TODO: Tom Matthews (FWC) data

## Habitat
Benthic community composition is changing.
Disease and bleaching are influential.

TODO: metrics, by taxa, over time, by reef type (i.e., patch, bank)

### Coral Cover
Coral Cover has been decreasing due to events and is unable to recover due to continuous stressors.
This decline over recent decades is easily visible in the following graphs from
[9B-Ruzicka WQPP Presentation_ May 2019.pptx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=181OYdxt0sXZYVNqz41f6m9KZQMdS2Ex0):

#### By Reef Type
TODO: CREMP (LM will categorize sites by reef type):

#### By Coral Type
TODO: Coral cover by species (Coral decreased)

### Macro-algae
TODO: Macro-algae cover (Algae increased)

### Gorgonian
TODO: Gorgonian cover (Gorgonian increased)
### Sponge
TODO: Sponge (in flux)
### Mangrove
TODO: Mangrove. data: [Global Mangrove Watch (1996 - 2016)](http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/4)
### Seagrass

# FKNMS Sub-regions
In many analyses it makes sense to split the Florida Reef Tract into sub-regions [[T. J. T. MurdochR. B. Aronson
 1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380050210)].
The regional subdivision of the reef tract is not well standardized, however.
The definition of the subregions used here and an explanation of this choice is discussed on the [fk-subdiv page](fk-subidv.md).
