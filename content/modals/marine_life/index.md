### FKNMS Sub-regions
In many analyses it makes sense to split the Florida Reef Tract into sub-regions [[T. J. T. MurdochR. B. Aronson
 1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003380050210)].
The regional subdivision of the reef tract is not well standardized, however.
The definition of the subregions used here and an explanation of this choice is discussed on the [fk-subdiv page](fk-subidv.md).

## Fish and Lobster inside/outside of MPAs (Aug)
TODO: BB and TM rework existing MBON/RVC data
TODO: LM will send formatted Tom Matthews Lobster data to BB and TM

## Benthic Community Composition has changed (After Aug)
TODO: TBD. Should be straightforward to rework existing MBON data

Benthic habitats in 2007 from [USGS's "*Benthic Ecosystems map and pie chart*"](https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/2007/1751/professional-paper/figures/benthic-ecosystems.html)

# Indicators:
## Fish abundance, diversity, size and species
TODO: Data: RVC data already available to FKNMS infographics

TODO: Snapper/grouper vs parrotfish (targeted/non-targeted)

TODO: Lobster size structure study [Not RVC data; not continuing to be collected so not for automation]

RVC fish in/out MPAs: MPAs work. ***Key Story for Aug***
Eg info-fk/corals -> Exploited Reef Fish (focal)

TODO: So consolidate time-series into snapper-grouper complex?
TODO: Alternative infographic data representation?

TODO: Lobster study: MPAs can cover a range of life history reqs/habitat
TODO: Tom Matthews (FWC) data


## Habitat metrics, by taxa, over time, by reef type (i.e., patch, bank),
in one graph:

TODO: Tech note: Can use [Annotation and Shading](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/gallery-annotations.html)

benthic community composition is changing.
disease and bleaching are influential.

TODO: CREMP (LM will categorize sites by reef type):

TODO:
* Coral cover by species (Coral decreased)
* Macro-algae cover (Algae increased)
* Gorgonian cover (Gorgonian increased)
* Sponge (in flux)
* Mangrove. data: [Global Mangrove Watch (1996 - 2016)](http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/4)
* Seagrass
