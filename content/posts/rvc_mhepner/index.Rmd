### Reef Visual Census Background

Reef fish community data used in this study were collected as part of the multi-agency Reef Visual Census (RVC) [Brandt et al., 2009](https://www.coris.noaa.gov/activities/fish_monitoring_protocol/). Fish communities were visually surveyed underwater annually in the mainland FKNMS (Lower Keys, Middle Keys and Upper Keys) from 1999 to 2012, and biennially from 2012 to 2016. The Dry Tortugas region was surveyed from 1999 to 2000 and biennially from 2004 to 2016.     

The RVC uses a stationary point count method within a randomly selected 7.5 m radius circular plot with a 200m map grid from 1999 to 2012 and 100m map grid from 2014 to 2016 to optimize the observation of conspicuous and diurnally active reef fish, specifically economically and ecologically important reef fish species [Bohnsack and Bannerot, 1986](https://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/NMFS/TR_NMFS/TR_NMFS_41.pdf).

### Objective

To analyze and compare changes in species richness, Simpson diversity, Shannon diversity and functional diversity in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) to reveal changes in temporal and spatial variability from 1999 â€“ 2016. The indices were assessed throughout the Florida Keys, between the upper and lower keys, between habitat types, and for different levels of management (Ecological Reserves (ER), Sanctuary Preservations Areas (SPA), and Special Use/Research Only Areas (SU/RO)).

## Diversity indicse as effective number of species

All indices were computed as effective number of species. Effective number of species is the number of equally abundance species needed to produce the observed value of a diversity index (Jost, 2006; Jost et al., 2010; MacArthur, 1965). Jost, 2006 refers to these as true measures of diversity, where prior to the conversion the diversity indices are simply measures of entropy.

- Species Richness is the number of species in a habitat sampled  

$Richness = \sum_{i=1}^S p_i^0$  

- Simpson diversity measures the probability that two individuals randomly selected from a sample will belong to different species.   

$Simpson = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^S p_i^2$  

- Shannon diveristy is a measure of entropy, it is the uncertainty in the species identity of a sample  

$Shannon = - \sum_{i=1}^S p_i \log_b p_i$  

- Functional diversity (Rao's Q) is a measure of pairwise functional differences between species weighted by their relative abundances   

$Rao Q = \sum_{i=1}^S-1 \sum_{j=i+1}^S d_i p_i p_j$
