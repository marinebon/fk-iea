Resident population.
“Florida’s population grows by almost 1,000 people each day”
“attracts more than 100 million visitors each year”
“four-fifths of Florida’s 209-percent population growth since 1970 has been from new residents moving into the state. Much of this in-migration comes from outside the United States – including 30 percent from the Caribbean and Central America, 17 percent from Asia, and 15 percent each from South American and Europe”
“over 31,000 migrants from Canada to Florida between 2005 and 2015, Florida saw more in-migration from Canada than Texas and New York combined!”
“Only 36 percent of Floridians were native to the state – down from 43 percent in 1950 – with the remaining 43 percent coming to Florida from other states.”
